The application contains some predefined levels, but you are able to fill the test tubes by your self, also.
The solver does a brute force and may not found the best solution.

This application is written with [Angular](https://angular.io/docs) and [@ngrx/store](https://ngrx.io/guide/store). Any kind of improvements are welcome, please add a feature wish or feature branch. Especially, the design would like to be improved.

Another solver by [Ed Riccardi](https://github.com/kuking/WaterSortPuzzleSolver) is using the GO language.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Next Steps

- create build and test pipelines
- provide a hosted application for using this app in a browser without any development environment.
